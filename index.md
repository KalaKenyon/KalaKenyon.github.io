I'm creating this blog to go through my learning journey.  For the purpose of this blog, I will be starting from the beginning to help anyone who is also starting a cybersecurity journey!

I currently work as a Web Application Penetration Tester and recently received a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics then followed that up by obtaining a Master of Science in Cybersecurity with a concentration in Cyber Defense.
